							<h2 id="Ketamine">What is Ketamine Therapy?</h2>
							<p>Ketamine is a medication originally developed as an anesthetic. In recent years, it has been studied and used at much lower doses to help with mental health conditions, especially when other treatments have not been effective. This is often referred to as ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) or ketamine infusion therapy depending on the setting.</p>
							<h3>How Ketamine Works</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Neuroplasticity: Ketamine stimulates growth of new connections between brain cells (synapses). This “reset” effect helps the brain become more flexible and open to change. </li>
								<li>Glutamate System: Unlike most antidepressants (which target serotonin), ketamine works on the glutamate system, creating a different and often faster pathway to mood improvement. </li>
								<li>Altered States of Consciousness: At therapeutic doses, ketamine can produce a dreamlike, dissociative state. This often allows clients to access insights, emotions, or memories in a different way than talk therapy alone.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Benefits & Usefulness</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>Rapid Relief - Many people report reduced depression, suicidal thinking, or anxiety within hours to days, rather than weeks (as with traditional antidepressants).</li>
								<li>Treatment-Resistant Conditions - Particularly useful for major depression, PTSD, and chronic anxiety when other medications/therapies haven’t worked.</li>
								<li>Supports Psychotherapy - The altered state can help clients approach painful memories or patterns with less fear and more openness. - Can deepen therapeutic work by increasing emotional access and reducing defensiveness.</li>
								<li>Interrupts Negative Cycles - Provides a “pause” in cycles of rumination, hopelessness, or trauma reactivity, giving space for new coping skills to take root.</li>
								<li>Potential for Spiritual or Existential Insights - Some clients describe a sense of perspective shift, increased self-compassion, or feeling connected to something larger than themselves.</li>
							</ol>
							<h3>Limitations & Considerations</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Not a cure on its own: Ketamine works best when paired with psychotherapy and lifestyle supports. </li>
								<li>Temporary effects: Benefits may fade; ongoing treatment or booster sessions may be needed. </li>
								<li>Side effects: Can include nausea, dizziness, dissociation, increased blood pressure, or anxiety during sessions. </li>
								<li>Safety concerns: Should only be administered under medical supervision, with proper screening for heart conditions, substance use, or psychosis.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Why Therapists Use Ketamine </h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Helps clients who feel “stuck” or resistant to progress.</li>
								<li>Allows access to unconscious material or repressed emotions in a safe, contained way.</li>
								<li>Can reduce suffering quickly in crisis situations (e.g., suicidal depression).</li> 
								<li>Complements other healing modalities, such as somatic therapy, mindfulness, or trauma work.</li>

							<h2 id="Mindfulness">What is Mindfulness?</h2>
							<p>Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment, on purpose, without judgment. It’s not about “emptying your mind” or forcing yourself to be calm — it’s about noticing what’s happening right now (your thoughts, feelings, sensations, and surroundings) without immediately reacting or trying to change it.</p>
							<p>It’s like training a mental muscle: the more you practice, the easier it becomes to step out of autopilot and respond to life with more clarity and choice.</p>
							<h3>Why Mindfulness is Useful</h3> 
								<ul>
									<li>Reduces stress — By noticing thoughts and emotions as they arise, you’re less likely to get swept away by them.</li>
									<li>Improves focus — Mindfulness trains your brain to return attention to what matters instead of being pulled in every direction.</li>
									<li>Regulates emotions — With practice, you can pause between a trigger and your reaction, making more intentional choices.</li>
									<li>Supports mental health — Mindfulness is linked to reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression, and burnout.</li>
									<li>Improves relationships — Being more present helps you listen deeply and communicate more effectively.</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>What Research Says</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Stress Reduction: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), an 8-week program developed by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, has been shown in over 40 years of research to significantly lower stress and improve overall well-being. </li>
								<li>Mental Health: A meta-analysis in JAMA Internal Medicine (2014) found that mindfulness meditation programs can improve anxiety, depression, and pain management. </li>
								<li>Productivity & Focus: Research from the University of Washington and University of Miami shows that brief daily mindfulness practices improve working memory, focus, and the ability to manage multiple demands. </li>
								<li>Brain Changes: MRI studies from Harvard University found that regular mindfulness practice can increase gray matter density in areas of the brain related to learning, memory, and emotional regulation.</li>
							</ul>


							<h3>How to Start</h3>
							<p>Mindfulness doesn’t require long hours of meditation. You can start small:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Take 3 slow breaths before answering a call or sending an email.</li>
								<li>Notice the taste, texture, and smell of your food for the first few bites of a meal.</li>
								<li>Pause for 1 minute to feel your feet on the floor and your breath moving in and out.</li>

										<h2>Jillian</h2>
										<p>I’m a Marriage and Family Therapist with a holistic approach that looks at the whole person- mind, body, and spirit. I’ve been practicing yoga for over 13 years and also teach trauma-informed yoga, which has deeply influenced the way I help clients feel grounded, safe, and connected to themselves. Meditation, movement, and mindfulness aren’t just things I talk about in sessions—they’re part of my daily life and the foundation of how I show up for others.</p>
										<p>I grew up between Southern California and Central Florida, and later spent 8 years in Las Vegas where I attended UNLV for undergrad and part of grad school. I became a mom during that time, an experience that continues to shape my empathy, patience, and perspective both personally and professionally.</p>
										<p>I have extensive experience working with teens and adults navigating eating disorders, as well as individuals and couples wanting to improve communication, rebuild trust, and strengthen connection. I truly love helping people feel more balanced, understood, and aligned with the life they want to create.</p>
										<p>At the heart of my work is the belief that healing is possible when we feel safe, seen, and supported. My goal is to help people heal and live the life they are truly capable of- one that feels grounded, connected, and authentic to who they are.</p>
										<h3>Rates</h3>
										<p>Individual therapy $90</p>
										<p>Couples: $100</p>
